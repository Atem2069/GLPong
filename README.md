# GLPong
quick and dirty pong game made using OpenGL.

Requires OpenGL 4.6 though context creation/GLSL can be edited to a minimum of 3.3 (explicit attrib/uniform bindings)

Use W/S for left paddle, UP/DN for right.

Uses the following libs: [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [GLAD (Generated from website)](https://glad.dav1d.de/), [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/) - Project include/lib dependency folders may need to be reconfigured, and libs rebuilt
